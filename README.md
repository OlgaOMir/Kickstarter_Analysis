# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to review the data set of over 4000 crowdfunding campaigns and to provide an insight on which specific factors can contribute to its success. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The analysis of the theater specific campaignsâ€™ outcomes based on the launch date of the campaign revealed that the number of successful campaigns launched in May and June is significantly higher the any other month. December shows the lowest number of the successful campaigns in the year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The second part of the analysis was to evaluate outcomes based on the goal amount of a campaign. As it turns out, with increase in the goal amount the success rate of a campaign decreased.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Analysis of outcomes based on goals proved to be most challenging. Please refer to the [COUNTIFS function resource page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/countifs-function-dda3dc6e-f74e-4aee-88bc-aa8c2a866842) for additional help.  

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
     
     Based on the analysis, campaigns that start in May or June and keep its goal under 5,000 would have a greater chance of being successful. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

     The success rate decreases as the campaign goal increases. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?

      A few limitations of this dataset are: 
          - The dataset is fairly smalls to draw conclusions
          - The dataset doesn't explicitly state that goals currency was converted to USD and we are working with the same currency throughout the dataset

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
